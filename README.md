# Gaussian-Fit-on-Emission-lines
This code fits a single gaussian in each pixel on the emission lines detected in the MUSE cube. The user needs to provide the observed wavelength of the emission line and fwhm. The code prints the integrated flux, integrated flux error, fwhm, fwhm error, central wavelength and central wavelength error.
